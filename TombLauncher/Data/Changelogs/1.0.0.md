# Tomb Launcher
## What is Tomb Launcher?
Tomb Launcher is a mod manager for the original Tomb Raider games. It is heavily inspired by Doom Launcher, a similar application for managing Doom WADs.

It allows you to discover new custom levels, keep them organized in one place, keep track of your play time, and much more.

This project is still under active development, and as such some things may not work perfectly yet or may straight up be broken.
